# üîê Cybersecurity & Utilities Toolkit  

This repository contains a collection of Python mini-projects that I built while learning **cybersecurity and Python programming**.  
Each script focuses on a different concept: **network scanning, password security, and encryption techniques**.  

The idea behind this repo is to practice Python while applying it to real-world security concepts.

## üìÇ Tools Included  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Port Scanner  
- Uses the `nmap` library to scan a target IP address.  
- Identifies open ports, running services, and protocols.  
- Helps understand how reconnaissance and network scanning works in cybersecurity.  

**Learning point**: I learned how to use external libraries (`python-nmap`) and also learnt about `virtual environment in Python` (virtualenv) and how network scanning reveals valuable security information.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Password Generator  
- Creates strong random passwords using letters, numbers, and special characters.  
- Default length is 12 characters but can be customized.  
- Demonstrates the importance of randomness in password security.  

**Learning point**: I practiced using Python‚Äôs `random` and `string` modules to create secure passwords it was fun Learning.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Password Manager  
- A simple CLI-based password manager.  
- Allows account creation and login with **SHA-256 password hashing**.  
- Stores hashed passwords instead of plain text, teaching the basics of secure storage.  

**Learning point**: I understood why hashing is important in cybersecurity and how authentication systems work.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Caesar Cipher  
- Implements the classic Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption.  
- Shifts letters in the alphabet by a given key.  
- Demonstrates basic cryptography concepts and how substitution ciphers work.  

**Learning point**: I explored how encryption works at a fundamental level before moving to modern cryptography.
